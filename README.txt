Assignment 2 is about data scraping with R and python using rvest(R), BeautifulSoup(python), RSelenium(R) and Selenium(python) and more.

The question asks the following:

Create a GitHub repository called “assignment_2” that includes:
1. a README.md file with a short markdown description of this assignment
2. a folder called “r_csv” with a R code for scraping the CSV example on cars (we want the table) in the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma- separated_values and saving the resulting output in the local folder (in CSV)
3. a folder called “python_csv” with a Python version of the code in point 2
Note that it is advised to use the packages rvest (R) and BeautifulSoup (Python) for scaping operations. RSelenium (R) and Selenium (Python) can also be used, but they are generally more complicated to setup.
